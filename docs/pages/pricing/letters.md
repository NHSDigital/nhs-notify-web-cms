The cost of sending a standard letter depends on the postage you choose and how many sheets of paper you need.

NHS Notify's standard postage rate is 70p + VAT per letter.

This is our most cost-effective option. While the cost to send a standard letter is 65p, we charge a blended rate of 70p to cover sending some letters as accessible formats.

Our price includes:

- paper
- postage
- double-sided black and white printing
- C5 size envelopes with an address window
- returned letter costs
- additional charge per letter to cover service costs

Speak to your onboarding manager if you need:

- to send letters with more than one double-sided sheet
- a different postage rate, such as 1st or 2nd class

## Additional charge for letters

From 1 August 2025, you'll pay a small additional charge for each letter you send with NHS Notify. This is included in our standard postage rate. We'll automatically add this charge to your monthly bill, based on the number of letters you send.

This additional charge will enable us to make improvements to the service and develop new features for all users of NHS Notify.

We'll support you to send more messages digitally to help reduce your costs.

## Letter inserts

If you need to include inserts such as leaflets with your letters, contact us by sending an email to <england.nhsnotify@nhs.net>.
