## Letter inserts

If you need to include inserts such as leaflets with your letters, contact us by sending an email to <england.nhsnotify@nhs.net>.

## Returned letter costs

There is an 18 pence charge for each letter you send that is returned. Returned letters are then destroyed for data security, which costs £5.99 (plus VAT) for every 10,000 letters.

Letters are sometimes returned because:

- the address is invalid or does not exist
- it has been refused by the recipient
- the address is vacant or the recipient is no longer there
