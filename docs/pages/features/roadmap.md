The NHS Notify roadmap shows what we’re working on and some of the things we’ve done.

The roadmap is only a guide. It does not cover everything we do, and some things may change.

You can [contact us]({% link pages/support/support.md %}) if you:

- have questions about the roadmap
- want to get involved in user research
- have suggestions for new features

## Things we're working on now

- Let users provide alternative contact details in certain approved circumstances
- Improve onboarding for new users
- Increase print capacity and resilience by bringing in an additional supplier
- Let users create and manage their own templates
- Fix accessibility issues in the upcoming 'create and submit a template' interface
- Provide real-time message statuses to show whether messages have been successfully delivered
- Show users which recipients have NHS App accounts and notifications enabled
- Let users subscribe to more detailed NHS APP message statuses

## Things we'll do later

- Let users manage their own routing plans
- Standardise letter printing using PDFs
- Improve how we validate postal addresses
- Develop more efficient onboarding processes
- Provide more granular message statuses for all channels
- Increase capacity for traffic from multiple users
- Enable letters sent to recipients to be shared to GP medical records
- Launch a real-time reporting dashboard

## Things we've done

- Let users send direct, one-to-one messages to recipients to enable more organisations and services to use NHS Notify
- Provided message statuses for single messages through the API, allowing users to build their own reporting solutions and see how their messages are performing
- Let users customise the text message sender name and the email address that messages are sent from, improving engagement and trust from recipients as they can verify who is messaging them
- Let users set up reply-to email address to enable recipients to respond to messages where needed
- Implemented a process to improve the accuracy of patient data in the Personal Demographics Service, increasing the reliability and effectiveness of messages
- Explored Rich Communication Services (RCS) messages as a new message channel, with the aim to reduce costs of longer text messages
- Let users send free-text NHS App messages without the need for templates, making it more efficient to message recipients on a one-to-one basis
- Let users have multiple, simultaneous campaigns so they can message recipients about different subjects while another campaign is still running
- Reformatted NHS numbers on printed letters to conform to NHS style guidelines
