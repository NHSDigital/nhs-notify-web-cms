Use NHS Notify to send:

- [NHS App messages]({% link pages/features/nhs-app-messages.md %})
- [emails]({% link pages/features/emails.md %})
- [text messages (SMS)]({% link pages/features/text-messages.md %})
- [letters]({% link pages/features/letters.md %})

You can send messages in bulk or individually.

## Send messages to groups of recipients without their contact details

You only need a person’s NHS number to send them messages. Learn how to [tell us who you want to message]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/tell-us-who-you-want-to-message.md %}).

Create specific cohorts of recipients by using [Cohorting as a Service (opens in a new tab)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/cohorting-as-a-service-caas){:target="\_blank"}.

## Write your messages

Create reusable templates for the message channels you want to use.

Once you’ve created a template you can:

- [add personalisation]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/personalisation.md %})
- [tell recipients who your messages are from]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/tell-recipients-who-your-messages-are-from.md %})

## Plan how your messages will be sent

Routing plans allow you to send messages to audiences more effectively and sometimes at lower costs.

You can set up routing plans to:

- use certain templates for specific audiences
- message a recipient with each channel in a specific order
- set up fallbacks for messages that fail
- stop sending messages after a channel is successful

## Prevent sending people unnecessary messages

NHS Notify uses the [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service) to automatically prevent you from messaging [recipients you cannot message]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/recipients-you-cannot-message.md %}).

## Reach people with additional needs

You can use NHS Notify to:

- [send letters in other languages]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/letters-in-other-languages.md %})
- [send letters in accessible formats]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/accessible-formats.md %})

## See how your messages perform

Track how many messages you’ve sent and find out which ones are not being delivered.

## Automatic sending

To send messages automatically, you’ll need a developer to integrate with the NHS Notify API.

[Read our API documentation (opens in a new tab)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-notify){:target="\_blank"}.
