## Letter specification

To send letters with NHS Notify, your content must meet our letter specification. This is done automatically for you when you create a letter template using NHS Notify.

The page size and layout is A4 portrait (210 x 297mm).

## Envelopes

NHS Notify uses C5 size envelopes with an address window. This means the A4 letter is folded in half with the recipient's address displayed in the address window.

### NHS barcode

Letters about test results, appointments and urgent messages can get [Royal Mail's NHS barcode (opens in a new tab)](https://www.royalmailwholesale.com/news/nhs-mail-new-barcode-solution){:target="\_blank"} on the envelope.

You'll need to send by 1st or 2nd class to be able to get the NHS barcode. If you choose NHS Notify's standard postage, you will not get the barcode but your postage rate will be much cheaper. Find out more about [pricing]({% link pages/pricing/letters.md %}).

The NHS barcode allows Royal Mail to identify NHS letters. During busy periods locally or nationally, Royal Mail will prioritise NHS letters using the NHS barcode.
