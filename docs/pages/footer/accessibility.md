It does not apply to:

This website is run by the NHS Notify team at NHS England. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

NHS Notify is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed in the next section.

## Non-accessible content

The following content is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

Autocomplete is turned off by default, making it harder to fill out any form elements when using 'create and submit a template'. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.5 (identity input purpose).

Autocomplete is turned off by default because the text a user enters into ‘create and submit a template’ will almost always be different for each submission. This makes autocomplete inappropriate for these fields. When we add new features that ask users for repeatable information, autocomplete will be enabled.

## What we're doing to improve accessibility
