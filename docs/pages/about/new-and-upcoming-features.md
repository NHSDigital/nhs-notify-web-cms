This page shows the latest updates to NHS Notify and what we plan to work on next.

This information is a guide. It does not cover everything we do and some things may change.

You can [contact us]({% link pages/support/support.md %}) if you:

- have questions about our latest features and upcoming plans
- want to get involved in user research
- have suggestions for new features

## Latest features and updates

- Enabled users to send text message notifications to prompt recipients to read their messages in the NHS App
- Enabled users to create and manage their own message templates
- Enabled multiple users to access the same service account so teams can manage work at the same time
- Let users provide alternative contact details in approved circumstances
- Introduced more choice for routing plan fallback timings (1 to 72 hours), giving users more flexibility to match message urgency

## What we're working on now

- Improving the speed of onboarding new users and providing clearer updates
- Increasing capacity and reliability of letter printing by adding new print suppliers
- Allowing users to manage their own routing plans from a list of standard options
- Improving letter template editing and proofing capabilities within the web interface
- Alpha testing how secondary care providers can send message content from letters as digital messages using the NHS App

## What we'll do later

- Introduce 2-way messaging between patients and clinicians through the NHS App
- Categorise messages by type to help identify types of messages sent and to report outcomes of different types of messages
- Enable users to send email notifications for recipients who have not read their messages in the NHS App
- Develop a more effective approach to reasonable and written language adjustments by using NHS patient flags and data from Patient Data Manager
- Introduce 2-way messaging between senders and recipients using text messages
