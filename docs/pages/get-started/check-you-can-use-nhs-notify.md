You can only use NHS Notify if your organisation or service sends:

- event-based messages
- direct messages
- messages that are part of a campaign

You must also:

- be funded, directly or indirectly, by the NHS or NHS England
- have funding or a budget agreed for sending messages
- intend to only send communications to patients or other members of the public – NHS Notify cannot be used to message NHS staff
- not use NHS Notify to send marketing communications
- check if other organisations or teams within NHS are already sending messages about the same subject matter
- have a way to get the NHS numbers of your recipients
- have technical or developer support to build your integration with NHS Notify

## Next step

If you meet all these criteria, you now need to make sure you’re ready commercially.
