## 1. Check if NHS Notify is right for you

You can only use NHS Notify if your organisation or service sends:

- [event-based messages]({% link pages/about/event-based-messaging.md %})
- [direct messages]({% link pages/about/direct-messaging.md %})
- [messages that are part of a campaign]({% link pages/about/campaigns.md %})

You also need to have:

- funding or a budget agreed for sending messages
- a way to get the NHS numbers of your recipients
- technical or developer support to build your integration with NHS Notify

You should also know [how to onboard with NHS Notify]({% link pages/get-started/onboard-with-notify.md %}).
