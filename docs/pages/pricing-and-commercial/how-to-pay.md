This page includes our payment terms and guidance on how to pay.

## Payment terms

The payment terms document is a financial agreement that sets out our charges and rules. It forms part of your wider connection agreement with NHS England.

We'll send the payment terms to you to sign digitally via DocuSign during onboarding. You must sign this document and set up the payment process before you can go live.

The <a href="/assets/commercialdocs/Payment%20terms%20NHS%20Notify%20-%20December%202025.pdf" target="_blank">payment terms (blank version)</a> are available for you to read beforehand.

## How charges and payment work

We charge based on the volume of messages you send, specifically letters and text messages. These charges cover the direct costs of providing the service.

### Charging rules

As detailed in the payment terms, the following rules apply:

- charges apply from the financial year 2025 to 2026 and onwards, until we send you an updated agreement
- we'll add VAT to your invoices - all prices listed in the payment terms and on our website exclude VAT
- we'll notify you before we introduce any price increases (for example, postal tariff changes)
- you must not add any margin or fees when charging any end user organisations - you can only pass on our costs

### Payment process

The process starts once you've signed the payment terms.

1. Send a purchase order (PO) to <england.nhsnotifyinvoicing@nhs.net>. Raise the PO based on your total expected annual charge per message channel.
2. Charges will apply from your 'service commencement’ date, which we'll confirm with you.
3. We'll provide monthly estimates of your charges within 20 days of the last day of the month.
4. We raise invoices every financial quarter in arrears through NHS Shared Business Services.
5. You must pay invoices within 30 days.

If you have any queries about the value of invoices, email <england.nhsnotifyinvoicing@nhs.net> within 3 months of when you received the invoice.
