This page describes how NHS England organisations and services pay for the messages they send using NHS Notify.

If you’re not part of NHS England but will soon be using NHS Notify, we're currently developing another payment process.

## Before you start

Your organisation or service must have the appropriate governance and approvals in place to pay for messages it sends with NHS Notify.

You must provide your cost centre number before you start sending messages. This is because NHS Notify initially covers your messaging costs and later cross charges your organisation.

## Cross charging

NHS Notify checks invoices from its suppliers against your monthly message volumes to see if they're correct. You'll soon be able to use our dashboard to track how much you’ve spent.

We then receipt supplier invoices with the NHS England finance team and cross charge your service or organisation at the end of the month.

You'll only ever be charged for the text messages and letters that you've sent.
