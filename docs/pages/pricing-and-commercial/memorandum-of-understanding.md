## About the memorandum of understanding

The memorandum of understanding is a written agreement between your service and NHS England. It sets out the terms for your use of NHS Notify.

The agreement is not a legally binding contract. It is a clear statement that both parties agree to follow the terms.

The agreement covers:

- how NHS England will make NHS Notify available to you
- your responsibility to comply with our acceptable use policies
- how you agree to pay for the service
- how you're responsible for any organisations you connect to NHS Notify
- how either party can end the agreement with 30 days of notice
