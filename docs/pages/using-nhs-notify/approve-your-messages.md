When you're ready to send messages to recipients, you'll need to approve final proofs of your messages. You'll do this every time you provide new templates.

This is to ensure that NHS Notify sends your messages exactly as you expect your recipients to get them.

## Before you get proofs of your templates

It's your responsibility to review your templates in a way that meets your organisation's needs. Check that your template:

- is approved by the relevant stakeholders in your team
- does not have any spelling errors
- is formatted correctly

Provide us with your final NHS App message, email or text message templates in Create and submit a template. Upload your final letter template.

## Getting proofs of your templates

We'll ask for the contact details of the person in your team who'll approve the proof message.

After you've provided your final templates, we'll email you with a screenshot, attachment or PDF of your proof message. We will not send actual messages or letters directly to you as part of the proofing process.

The proof message will show you example personalisation data if you've added any [personalisation]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/personalisation.md %}). If any personalisation data does not appear how you expect, you may need to check if you've used the correct personalisation fields or example personalisation data.

Any delays to you approving your proofs could slow down when you can start sending messages to recipients.

### Approving your proof

If your proof matches the final template you provided to us, reply to our email and tell us that you approve your proof message.

### If you need to reject your proof

If the content or formatting of your proof does not match the template you originally provided, reply to our email to describe what's wrong with the proof. We'll update the proof message and email it to you again.

If you need to make further changes to your original template, update your original template in Create and submit a template (or upload your letter template) and send it to us again so that we can create a new proof.
