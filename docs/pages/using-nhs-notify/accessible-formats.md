Before you start to send messages, consider the access needs of your recipients.

All organisations that provide NHS care or publicly-funded adult social care are legally required to follow the [NHS England's Accessible Information Standard](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/patient-equalities-programme/equality-frameworks-and-information-standards/accessibleinfo/).

## Accessible letter formats

NHS Notify offers the following letter formats so you can reach people with access needs.

| Accessible format | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large print       | Letters that have a larger font than usual. Large print letters typically have a point size of 16 and above.                                                                                                                     |
| Braille           | Includes the original letter and a Braille insert. NHS Notify uses the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to translate your content into Braille so that blind and partially sighted people can read your messages. |
| Audio CD          | Includes the original letter and a CD that plays a spoken recording of your letter's content.                                                                                                                                    |

## Other accessible formats

You can include links in your messages to take recipients to other accessible formats such as:

- easy read
- British Sign Language (BSL)

You’ll need to arrange these accessible formats. NHS Notify does not provide them for you.

This is available for all message channels.

## How to send messages in accessible formats

### 1. Tell us if you’ll need accessible formats

Do this by:

- speaking to our engagement team when you first [get started]({% link pages/get-started/get-started.md %}) with NHS Notify
- raising a [Service Now request](https://nhsdigitallive.service-now.com/csm) if you're already using NHS Notify and have existing templates

### 2. Create your templates and routing plans

Set up a routing plan that requests accessible formats.

Create separate templates for each type of accessible format you’ll need. Select the ‘standard letter’ template type.

### 3. Provide recipients' NHS numbers

Provide recipients' NHS numbers as separate data files for each type of accessible format.

### 4. We'll check for recipients with access needs

NHS Notify checks for recipients who need letters in accessible formats using the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service).

It’s your responsibility to message recipients based on their access needs.

We’ll only send the accessible format if:

- you’ve created an accessible template that matches
- PDS confirms they have access needs

We’ll send the standard letter if you’ve not given us the accessible template, even if PDS says there are recipients with access needs.
