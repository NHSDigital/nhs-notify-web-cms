To send an NHS App message, email, text message or letter with NHS Notify, you need to add a message template.

Templates let you send the same thing to lots of people without writing a new message each time.

You can:

- create new templates
- add formatting, links and personalisation
- copy an existing template
- save a template as a draft and edit it later
- submit your final templates to NHS Notify to set up the messages you want to send

## Before you start

You can only create and submit templates when you're accepted to [onboard with NHS Notify]({% link pages/get-started/get-started.md %}) and have access to our integration environment.

You can sign in with your Care Identity. We'll support you to set this up.
