## What’s changing

In line with the 2025 to 2026 operational planning guidance, all NHS providers are expected to send messages to patients through the NHS App first, using NHS Notify as the default service.

This means using digital channels wherever possible, while still making sure no one is excluded.

## What this means

As set out in the guidance, all providers will need to send messages to patients with the NHS App first, using NHS Notify.

NHS England is working with secondary care trusts and their suppliers to support this change - helping to improve digital communication with recipients and reduce costs across the system.

Over the coming months, we’ll be working closely with trusts to test and roll out solutions that make sure all recipients’ messages can be viewed in the NHS App. We'll also focus on getting the best value for money from other channels like text messages and letters.

If you're a trust or supplier and want to explore how NHS Notify can support your messaging plans, you can visit our [get started](https://notify.nhs.uk/get-started/) page and complete the registration form.
