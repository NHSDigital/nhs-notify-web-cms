## NHS App messages

NHS Notify can send NHS App messages to recipients with the NHS App at any time.

If a recipient has notifications turned on, they’ll also receive a push notification.

Push notifications are only sent to recipients between 6am and 10pm. If you send a message outside of these hours, the notification will be sent from 6am.

## Emails

Once an email has been sent, our email provider will try to deliver it to the recipient for up to 72 hours.

NHS Notify will only send emails from 8am to 6pm on weekdays.

### Open rates and click-throughs

NHS Notify cannot tell you if your users open an email or click on the links in an email.

We do not track open rates and click-throughs because of privacy issues. Tracking emails without asking permission from users could breach General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

## Text messages (SMS)

Once a text message has been sent, our text message provider will try to deliver it to the recipient for up to 72 hours.

NHS Notify will only send text messages from 8am to 6pm on weekdays.

## Letters

Once you've made a request with [NHS Notify API]({% link pages/about/api.md %}) or [NHS Notify MESH]({% link pages/about/mesh.md %}), it can take up to 2 working days for our suppliers to dispatch your letter.

We use NHS Notify's standard postage as our default for letters. Most letters get delivered 3 business days after they're dispatched.

If you need different postage, such as 1st or 2nd class, speak to your onboarding manager.
