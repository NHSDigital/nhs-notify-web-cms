NHS England organisations and services can use the [Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh) to send messages with NHS Notify.

You should only use MESH to send messages if your organisation or service:

- has limited developer or technical capacity
- only needs to send batches of messages to specific groups of recipients
- does not need advanced features offered by NHS Notify API

[Read our MESH documentation (opens in a new tab)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-notify-mesh).

Check if MESH is right for you by contacting our engagement team at <england.nhsnotify@nhs.net>.
