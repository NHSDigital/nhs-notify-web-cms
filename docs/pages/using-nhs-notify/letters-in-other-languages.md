## How to send letters in other languages

### Create your templates

You're responsible for translating your message content. NHS Notify does not offer a translation service.

Create your messages using the 'standard letter' template type.

Include both the English version and the translated version in a single template.

The letter will be on double-sided paper.

Aim to keep your message content to 2 double-sided sheets to save costs. This will include:

- the English version on one double-sided sheet
- the translation on another double-sided sheet

### We'll check for recipients who need letters in other languages

You can decide whether to message recipients based on their language preferences.

NHS Notify checks who needs letters in other languages, but we’ll only send them these if:

- you've created a template in another language that matches
- PDS confirms they need messages in this language

We’ll send the letter in English if you've not given us the translation, even if PDS says recipients need messages in other languages.
