When you're ready to send messages to recipients, you'll need to approve final proofs of your messages. You'll do this every time you submit new templates.

This is to ensure that NHS Notify sends your messages exactly as you expect your recipients to get them.

After you've submitted your final templates, we'll share proof versions of your messages with you by email for you to approve.

We will not send actual messages or letters directly to you as part of the proofing process.

It's your responsibility to review the proof messages in a way that meets your organisation's needs. This includes making sure you've got approvals from the relevant stakeholders in your team. Compare your proofs against the final templates you submitted to us.

The proof message will show you example personalisation data if you've added any [personalisation]({% link pages/using-nhs-notify/personalisation.md %}). If any personalisation data does not appear how you expect, you may need to check if you've used the correct personalisation fields or example personalisation data.

Find out how to approve or reject your proofs for:

- [NHS App messages, emails and text messages](#nhs-app-message-email-and-text-message-proofing)<!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
- [letters](#letter-proofing)

Any delays to you approving or rejecting your proofs could slow down when you can start sending messages to recipients.
